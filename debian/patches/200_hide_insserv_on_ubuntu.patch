Description: Move insserv binaries out of the default path
 On Ubuntu, running insserv directly can devastate your boot and
 shutdown sequence. This can cause many problems, including data loss
 and incomplete migrations on upgrades (such as the /run migration)
 .
 Since 3rd-party software packages are known to run insserv directly
 if it's available, this patch makes it unavailable by moving it to
 /usr/lib, where it can't cause as much trouble.
